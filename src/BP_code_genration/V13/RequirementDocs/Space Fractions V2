Behavior INSTRUCTIONS:


At the start of the game, When the user clicks on the start button, the game will move to the movie component. 


Upon entrance to the movie component, the introductory movie will begin 
playing. If a mouse click is received, this component will terminate the movie 
and forward the user to the main menu component. Otherwise, the movie will 
continue to its completion and the user will be moved to the main menu.

The main menu component will wait until the user selects a button. At that time, the user 
will be forwarded to the game sequence component or the Denominators' web 
page, depending on the button selected

The game sequence component will display a question, and then wait until the user chooses an 
answer. 
If the user selects the correct answer, a message to this effect will be 
displayed and the component will move to the next question. 
If the incorrect answer is selected, this component will inform the user of 
this and give them another chance to answer the question. However, their 
score will not count this question as being answered correctly. 
At certain "critical points," this component will choose different directions 
in the plot based on whether the question at the critical point was 
answered correctly. 
After the user has proceeded through a set number of questions, they will 
be directed to the ending scene component.
