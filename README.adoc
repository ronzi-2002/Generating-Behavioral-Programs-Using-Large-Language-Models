# main_client_server_java:
The files inside this directory support the client-server model with BP. A BP program runs in the backend, sending events from the BP program and receiving events from the client, passing them to the BP program.
For each BP program, there is a corresponding "frontend" consisting of a HTML. 

To run the program, use the next steps:
    1. Run main_with_external (This is the file you will run to initiate the server and the bp program)
        *Before running use the variable of the system you want to run
    2. Open the HTML file(Directly in Chrome) of the BP program ran
*In any case you want to start over, you will need to restart the Backend(main_with_external), and then refresh your page
